/**************************************************************************************************************
 * This file contains a simplified ASP.NET Resource Provider that doesn't create a custom Resource Manager.
 * This implementation is much simpler than the full resource provider, but it's also not as integrated as
 * the full implementation. You can use this provider safely to serve resources, but for resource
 * editing and Visual Studio integration preferrably use the full provider.
 * 
 * This class shows how the Provider model works a little more clearly because this class is
 * self contained with the exception of the data access code and you can use this as a starting
 * point to build a custom provider. There are no ResourceReaders/Writers just a nested collection 
 * of resources.
 * 
 * This class uses DbResourceDataManager to retrieve and write resources in exactly two
 * places of the code. If you prefer you can replace these two locations with your own custom
 * Resource implementation. They are marked with:
 * 
 * // DEPENDENCY HERE
 * 
 * However, I would still recommend going with the full resource manager based implementation
 * because it works in any .NET application, not just ASP.NET. But a full resource manager
 * based implementation is much more complicated to create.
