# West Wind Globalization for ASP.NET Core

This repo is a fully functional proof-of-concept of using West Wind Globalization in a pure .NET Core project. To get started, check out `Westwind.Globalization.Core.Sample`.

Status:

- [x] Migrate from `Westwind.Utilities.Configuration` to the new [.NET Core Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration)
- [x] Replace HttpHandlers with an MVC Core Controller
- [x] Update admin app to work with the new controller (See `Westwind.Globalization.Core.Sample`)
- [x] Import and export of ResX
- [ ] Export strongly typed classes
- [ ] Localization of images and binary files
- [ ] Update tests
- [ ] Publish to NuGet
- [ ] Support other DB providers than MSSQL

## Getting started:

- Make sure you have the latest version of VS2017 15.3 (currently Preview 6)
- Copy the latest `.nupkg` packages from `Nuget/Westwind.Globalization.Core` and `Nuget/Westwind.Globalization.Core.Web` into a folder in your solution, e.g. `local_packages`
- Add a `NuGet.config` to your solution root:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="LocalPackages" value="local_packages" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
- In a new or existing ASP.NET Core 2.0 project, add a `<PackageReference Include="Westwind.Globalization.Core.Web" Version="1.0.0-preview-002" />` directly in .csproj, or via NuGet dialog in VS2017.
- In Startup.cs:
```csharp
public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

public Startup(IConfiguration configuration) {
    this.Configuration = configuration;
}

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    services.AddWestwindGlobalization(Configuration);
    ...
}
```
- Add a connection string to your database in `appSettings.json` for `DbResourceConfiguration:ConnectionString`
- Copy the `LocalizationAdmin` folder from `Westwind.Globalization.Core.Sample` into your `wwwroot`
- (Optional) Copy `LocalizationForm.resx` from `Westwind.Globalization.Core.Sample` into a folder named `Properties` in your project
- Start the website and go to e.g. `http://localhost:5000/LocalizationAdmin`

The following original readme has not been updated for .NET Core, but is included for reference.

# West Wind Globalization

### Database Resource Localization for .NET

This library and tooling provides easy to use database resource managers and providers that allow you to use a database for storing localization resources. Unlike static Resx resources, database resources are dynamic and can be changed at runtime and are editable by multiple users at the same time. The custom resource managers and providers use the standard .NET resource infrastructure, so other than startup configuration there are no code changes when switching from using traditional Resx resources - and you can always switch back just as easily.

A rich, Web based resource editor is also provided that makes it easy to create resource content and translate it interactively in a running application where you can see resource changes immediately applied without recompilation. You can import and export Resx resources, generate strongly typed classes and serve resources to JavaScript applications using the database resources. 

To install, use NuGet:

```
PM> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization.Web.Starter
```
or if you don't want sample resources and a test page, simply use:
```
PM> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization.Web
```

If you're not using a Web Project or you're using MVC/Web API **and** don't need the Web Resource Editor you can just use the core package:
```
PM> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization
```

Please read the Installation Section below or watch the [Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/ABR7ISppB1k), which describes how to install the packages, configure the project, import existing resources (if any) and then start creating new ones quickly.

> If you want to see how to apply resources in your applications, it's also a good idea to clone this project as it has a number of examples that demonstrate resource usage. Check out the AlbumViewer MVC application, the Localization Admin AngularJs SPA application, and the ResourceTest ASPX and Web Page examples.

Requirements:
* .NET 4.5 or later
* SQL Server 2008-2014, SQL Server Express, SQL Compact 4, MySql, SqLite

### Features
* .NET Resources in Sql Server, SqlCe, MySql and SqLite   
* ASP.NET Database ResourceProviders (ASP.NET/WebForms) 
* .NET  ResourceManager (ASP.NET MVC,non-Web apps)
* Uses standard .NET Resource infrastructure and caching
* Or: Use our dynamic DbRes string based helper (works anywhere)
* Interactive Web Resource Editor to edit Resources
* Keyboard optimized resources editing
* Translate text resources with Google or Bing
* Use Markdown in your text resources
* Import and export Resx resources 
* Generate strongly typed classes from the Db resources
* Release and reload resources in running Web apps
* Serve .NET Resources to JavaScript as JSON
* Create your own custom DbResourceManagers
* Directly access and manage DbResources with code 


Because this library uses the standard .NET resource infrastructure using the DbResourceProvider or DbResourceManager requires no code changes from ResX resources, other than provider configuration in your .config file and potentially a few lines of startup code.  You can import existing Resx resources and edit them interactively. Serve your resources either with the DbResourceProvider or DbResourceManager, or if you chose export them back out to Resx files for your final application code. Importing and exporting is a easily done from the Web admin interface or can be fired using code including as part of your build process.

> **Note**: The database is accessed only once per ResourceSet and per Locale, using the
> standard .NET Resource caching architecture used in Resource Providers and
> Resource Managers, so database access and usage is minimal. You can use these 
> Providers/Manager in MVC, WebForms and even in non Web applications.

### Web Resource Editor
One of the main reasons people want to use Database resources rather
than Resx resources is that it allows for dynamic updates of resources. Resx
resources are static and compiled into an application and so are typically
tied to the development process, while dynamic resources can be updated
separately even after the application has been completed and deployed.

Since data is stored in a database it's easy to create editing front ends
or programmatic tools that simply manipulate the database. This library
ships with a Web interface that allows editing of resources interactively
and an easy to use data API to update resources programmatically.

![Web Resource Editor](WebResourceLocalizationForm.png)

![Web Resource Translator Dialog](WebResourceTranslateDialog.png)

The resource editor is an easy way to localize resources interactively,
but it's not the only way you can do this of course. Since you have access 
to the data API underneath it as well as the database itself, it's 
easy to create your own customized UI or data driven API that suits your
application needs exactly.

> **Markdown Support** The resource edit form allows you to optionally use Markdown for resource editing which in addition to localization makes it possible to use this libary as a basic CMS to manage user manageable content in your applications.


### How the database Providers work
This library implements a custom .NET ResourceManager and 
ASP.NET ResourceProvider that are tied to a database provider interface.
(although you can implement non-data providers as well). This means you 
can access resources using the same mechanisms that you
use with standard Resx Resources in your .NET applications. It also
means although resources are initially loaded from the database
for the first load of each ResourceSet. .NET then caches resources 
for each individual ResourceSet and locale the same way that Resx 
resources are read from the assembly resources and then cached. 
**The database is hit only for the first read of a given 
ResourceSet/Locale combination - not every resource access
hits the database!**

The DbResourceManager can be used in any type of .NET application using
the `DbRes` class methods, generated strongly typed classes, or using the Resource
Manager directly. The DbResourceProvider classes can be used in ASP.NET
applications - especially for WebForms with support for local and global
resources, implicit resources and control meta tags. MVC applications
typically use the ResourceManager with strongly typed resources or the
`DbRes` classes or by exporting resources back into RESX 

Underneath the .NET providers lies a the Westwind.Globalization data
access layer (IDbResourceDataManager) that provides the data interface 
to provide access to various providers. The default provider uses SQL Server
as a data source with additional providers available for MySql, SqLite and
SqlCompact. This API is accessed by the Resource Provider and Resource Manager
implementations to read the resources from the database.

Additionally the API can be directly accessed to provide resource 
access, and the DbRes helper class provides very easy access to
these resources using the DbRes.T() method which can be thought
of as a high level translation method.

This interface is also directly accessible and allows your code as well as
support code like the UI Web Resource editor to easily access and manipulate
resources in real-time at runtime.


This library includes quite a proliferation of classes most of it due
to the implementation requirements for the .NET providers which require
implementation of a host of interface based classes for customization.

There are three distinct resource access mechanisms supported:

* ASP.NET Resource Provider (best used with WebForms)
* .NET Resource Manager and strongly typed resources 
  (Non-Web apps, and or MVC apps where you already use Resx)
* Direct Db Provider access using DbRes helper (easiest overall - works everywhere)

## Running the Sample Application
To run the sample application you have to set up a database to provide the resources. The following assumes you are using the default configuration which uses SQL Server and a database named *Localizations* - you can  change this via web.config settings (see the following section for more details). 
 
* Create a SQL Server/Express Database called `Localizations`
* Make sure the IIS Web User using has rights to create a Database in this DB
* Open http://localhost:xxxxx/LocalizationAdmin/ in your browser
* You'll get an error message like: <br/>
  *ResourceLoadingFailed: Invalid Object Name Localizations*
* Use the `Create Table` button to create the *Localizations* table
* Use `Import or Export Resx` button to import resources from the project into the db
* Select `Import Resources`	from the dropdown
* You should now have all the sample and LocalizationForm resources in the db
* Open the `ResourceTest.cshtml` to test resource operation

## Installation and Configuration
The easiest way to use this library in your own applications is to install the NuGet package into an ASP.NET application.

```
pm> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization.Web.Starter
```
If you don't need sample resources and a test page you can use the base Web package instead.
```
pm> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization.Web
```

If you're not using a Web Project, or an MVC/Web API project that doesn't use the Web Resource Editor you can use the core package:
```
pm> Install-Package Westwind.Globalization
```
which doesn't install the web related components and HTML resources. 

The .Web version installs the required assemblies, adds a few configuration entries in web.config and enables the resource provider by default. The Starter package adds sample resources and a couple of test pages. I recommend you use the .Starter package so you can ensure the provider is working and serving resources - once up and running you can remove the starter package, leaving the dependent assemblies in place.

#### Configuration Settings
The key configuration items set are the DbResourceConfiguration section in
the config file which tells the provider where to find the database
resources:

```xml
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="DbResourceConfiguration" requirePermission="false" 
			 type="System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler,System,Version=1.0.3300.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" />
  </configSections>  

  <DbResourceConfiguration>
    <add key="ConnectionString" value="server=.;database=Localizations;integrated security=true;" />
    <add key="ResourceTableName" value="Localizations" />
    <add key="AddMissingResources" value="False" />

    <!-- Resource Imports and Exports -->
    <add key="ResxExportProjectType" value="Project" />
    <add key="StronglyTypedGlobalResource" value="~/Properties/Resources.cs" />
    <add key="ResourceBaseNamespace" value="WebApplication1.Properties" />    
    <add key="ResxBaseFolder" value="~/Properties" />

    <!-- WebForms specific only -->
    <add key="LocalizationFormWebPath" value="~/LocalizationAdmin/" />
    <add key="DesignTimeVirtualPath" value="" />
    <add key="ShowLocalizationControlOptions" value="False" />
    <add key="ShowControlIcons" value="False" />

    <!-- Google Translate API -->
    <add key="GoogleApiKey" value="" />

    <!-- Bing Translation -->
    <add key="BingClientId" value="" />
    <add key="BingClientSecret" value="" />    
  </DbResourceConfiguration>

  <!-- Enable ASP.NET Resource Provider  -->
  <system.web>
    <globalization resourceProviderFactoryType=
     "Westwind.Globalization.DbSimpleResourceProviderFactory,Westwind.Globalization.Web" />
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

**ConnectionString and ResourceTableName**<br/>
The two most important keys are the connectionString and resourceTableName which point at your database and a table that holds resources. You can use either a raw connection string as above or a connection string name in the `<ConnectionStrings>` section of your config file.

**AddMissingResources**
When set to true causes any resource lookup that fails to produce matching resource ID to write the invariant resource into the database. Use with caution - as this might slow down your application significantly as you now write to the database on any missing resources. Use only during development and testing to get resources into the system for easier debugging later.

**ResxExportProjectType**<br/>
This option determines how the Resx export feature works. The two options are `Project` or `WebForms`. Project exports all resource files into \properties folder underneath the resxBasePath and excludes any resource sets that include a . in their name (assumed to be ASP.NET resources). WebForms writes out resources into folder specific App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folders based on the root folder

**ResxBaseFolder**<br/>
The base folder that's used for all Resx Import and Export operations. The default is ~/ which is the root web folder, but you can specify a full OS path here. Note that this allows you to read/write resources in other non-web projects - as long as your Web application has writes to the folder specified.

**StronglyTypeGlobalResource and ResourceBaseNamespace**<br/>
If you do a strongly typed class export from the admin manager all resources will be created in a single file in the this file using the ResourceBaseNameSpace as the namespace in the generated class.


#### Run the Web Resource Editor
In order to use database resources you'll actually have to create some resources in a database. Make sure you've first added a valid connection string in the config file in the last step! Then open the `/LocalizationAdmin/` in your browser and click on the *Create Table* button in the toolbar.

Once the table's been created you can now start creation of resources interactively, by directly
adding values to the database table, or by using the DbResourceDataManager API to manipulate the
data programmatically.

By default a `Resources` ResourceSet has been provided for you the resources of which are used in the test page. You can remove those resources or the resource set as needed once you know the provider works. ResourceSets are logical groups of resources that belong together - I like to use one ResourceSet per form or per application feature depending on how much content is involved. But you can also use a single ResourceSet for your entire application if you want. Whatever works for you to make it easy to find resources.

#### Import Existing Resources
I also recommend that you first perform an *Import Resx* step to pull any existing Resx resources in your project into the application. This will also import the Localization form's resources into your database so that the localization form properly localizes.  


## Setting ASP.NET Locale based on Browser Locale
In order to do automatic localization based on a browser's language used you can
sniff the browser's default language and set the UiCulture in the Begin_Request 
handler of your ASP.NET application class. A helper method to provide this 
functionality automatically is provided.

```C#
protected void Application_BeginRequest()
{
    // Automatically set the user's locale to what the browser returns
    // and optionally only allow certain locales/locale-prefixes
    WebUtils.SetUserLocale(allowLocales: "en,de");
}
```

This forces the user's Culture and UI Culture to whatever the browser is using,
and explicitly. Now when a page is rendered it will use the UiCulture of the browser.
The optional allowLocales enforces that only certain locales can be set - anything
not matched is defaulted to the server's default locale.

The way .NET resource managers work, if there's no match for the locale the user
provides, resources fall back to the closest matching locale or the invariant locale.
So if the user comes in with it-IT but you don't support it or it-IT in your resources
the user will see resources for invariant. Likewise if a user comes in with 
de-CH (Swiss german) and you de (without a locale specific suffix) the de German
version will be returned. Resource Fallback tries to ensure that always something
is returned.

## Using Resources in your Application
There are a number of different ways to access resources from this provider.

* Direct access with DbRes 
* ASP.NET Resource provider
* .NET Resource Manager

### DbRes Helper Class
The DbRes Helper class is a wrapper around the DbResourceManager and DbResouceDataManager
object. The DbRes class contains a handful of common use static methods that are used to 
retrieve and manipulate resources.

In an ASP.NET Web MVC (or WebPages) application you can use:

```C#
// Using current UiCulture - empty resource set
DbRes.T("HelloWorld")

// Exact match with resource - Hallo Welt
DbRes.T("HelloWorld","Resources","de")

// Resource Fallback to de if de-CH doesn't exist - Hallo Welt
DbRes.T("HelloWorld","Resources","de-CH")
```

This is an easy mechanism that's tied closely to the database
resources created and can be applied with minimal fuss in any
kind of .NET application.

### ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET WebPages
```HTML
Say Hello: @DbRes.T("HelloWorld") at @DateTime.Now
```

### ASP.NET WebForms
```HTML
Say Hello: <%: DbRes.T("HelloWorld") %> at <%= DateTime.Now %>
```

### In .NET code
```HTML
string value = DbRes.T("HelloWorld");
```

The `DbRes.T()` method returns the ResourceId passed in if a resource is missing in the ResourceSet which can be useful for providing 'default' text. Some people like to use full resource strings as their resource Ids so default values are always available even if a resource is missing or the provider is not available. 

## Using the ASP.NET Resource Provider 
If you're using an existing WebForms application or you want to
use the ASP.NET based Resource Provider model for accessing resources
you can use the DbSimpleResourceProvider. This implementation is an
ASP.NET Resource Provider implementation that directly accesses the
DbResourceDataManager to retrieve resources. A second Resource Provider
implementation that uses the DbResourceProvider uses the DbResourceManager
to indirectly access resources. Typically the DbSimpleResourceProvider is
the more efficient interface.

To use this provider you have to enable it in web.config. To do so:

```XML
<configuration>  
  <system.web>
       <globalization resourceProviderFactoryType="Westwind.Globalization.DbSimpleResourceProviderFactory,Westwind.Globalization.Web" />    
       <!--<globalization resourceProviderFactoryType="Westwind.Globalization.DbResourceProviderFactory,Westwind.Globalization" />-->    
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

Once enabled you can use all the standard ASP.NET Resource Provider
features:

* GetGlobalResourceObject, GetLocalResourceObject on Page and HttpContext
* Using meta:resourcekey attributes on Web Controls

### Page.GetGlobalResourceObject() or HttpContext.GetGlobalResourceObject() 
```HTML
<legend>ASP.NET ResourceProvider</legend>
<label>Get GlobalResource Object (default locale):</label>
<%: Page.GetGlobalResourceObject("Resources","HelloWorld") %>
```

### Page.GetLocalResourceObject()
```HTML
<label>GetLocalResourceObject via Expression:</label>                 
<%: GetLocalResourceObject("lblHelloWorldLabel.Text") %>
```

### WebForms Control meta:resourcekey attribute
```HTML
<label>Meta Tag (key lblHelloWorldLabel.Text):</label>
<asp:Label ID="lblHelloLabel" runat="server" meta:resourcekey="lblHelloWorldLabel"></asp:Label>
```

### WebForms Resource Expressions
```HTML
<label>Resource Expressions (Global Resources):</label>
<asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="<%$ Resources:Resources,HelloWorld %>"></asp:Label>
```


## Strongly typed Resources
The Web Resource Editor form allows you to create strongly typed resources
for any global resources in your application. Basically it'll go through all the 
non-local resources in your file and create strongly type .NET classes in a file that
is specified in the DbResourceProvider configuration settings.

```
<add key="StronglyTypedGlobalResource" value="~/Properties/Resources.cs" />
<add key="ResourceBaseNamespace" value="WebApplication1.Properties" />
```
You specify the namespace and filename to generate it to. Once you've generated the strongly typed resource file with the embedded resource class(es), you need to recompile your application to make the resource properties available to it.
 
The generated resources can use either the ASP.NET resource provider (which uses
whatever provider is configured - Resx or DbResourceProvider) or the 
DbResourceManager which only uses the DbResourceManager. Using the latter allows
you to also generate resources for use in non-Web applications.

Here's what generated resources look like:
```C#
namespace WebApplication1.Properties
{
    public class GeneratedResourceSettings
    {
        // You can change the ResourceAccess Mode globally in Application_Start  
        // AspNetResourceProvider, Project (MVC, Windows), Resx      
        public static ResourceAccessMode ResourceAccessMode = ResourceAccessMode.AspNetResourceProvider;
    }

	public class Commonwords
	{
		public static System.String Ready
		{
			get
			{
				if (GeneratedResourceSettings.ResourceAccessMode == ResourceAccessMode.AspNetResourceProvider)
					return (System.String) HttpContext.GetGlobalResourceObject("Commonwords","Ready");
				return DbRes.T("Ready","Commonwords");
			}
		}

		public static System.String ThisIsALongLineOfText
		{
			get
			{
				if (GeneratedResourceSettings.ResourceAccessMode == ResourceAccessMode.AspNetResourceProvider)
					return (System.String) HttpContext.GetGlobalResourceObject("Commonwords","This is a long line of text");
				return DbRes.T("This is a long line of text","Commonwords");
			}
		}
	}
}
```

These can then be used in any ASP.NET application:

##### ASP.NET MVC or WebPages
```HTML
<div class="statusbar">@CommonWords.Ready</div>
```

##### ASP.NET WebForms
```HTML
<div class="statusbar"><%: WebApplication1.CommonWords.Ready %></div>
```
#### .NET Code
```C#
string ready = CommonWords.Ready;
```

Note that strongly typed resources must be re-generated whenever you add new
resources, so this is an ongoing process. As with the Resx Generator if
you remove or rename a resource you may break your code. 

Strongly typed resources are generated into a single file for all the resource sets exported in order to not clutter up your application with unnecessary generated files.  

## ASP.NET MVC ModelValidation
ASP.NET and Entity Framework support model validation and you can also use the database provider to localize these validation messages. To do so **you have to generate strongly typed resources**, or export to Resx and then enable strong resource typing. ASP.NET/EntityFramework Model validation works based on class property access so in order to use it a type has to exist.

To do this:

* Open the Localization Administration form 
* Use *Export Class* to export create a class
* Or: Use *Export to Resx* to export Resx files (in Project mode)<br/>
then make sure to enable the strong type generation on the Resx and choose *Public class*

Once you've done this you can create your validation classes like you always would:

```c#
public class ViewModelWithLocalizedAttributes
{
    [Required(ErrorMessageResourceName = "NameIsRequired", ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof(Resources))]
    public string Name { get; set;  }

    [Required(ErrorMessageResourceName = "AddressIsRequired", ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof(Resources))]
    public string Address { get; set;  }
}
```

The type will be your exported class or generated Resx class and the name is the name of the property on the generated object. DataAnnotations use Reflection to lookup the property name, so if for some reason the validation does not work check the following:

* Make sure the property name is typed correctly and matches a property name.
* Try writing out the actual property using @Resources.AddressIsRequired to ensure the value is valid (on a simple test page perferrably). 

## Non Sql Server Database Providers
By default the resource providers and manager use **SQL Server** to hold the database resources. If you don't do any custom configuration in code to specify the Configuration.DbResourceDataManagerType you'll get the Sql Server provider/manager. 

However, all of the following providers are supported:

* Sql Server (2008, 2012, Express, Azure(?))
* Sql Server Compact
* MySql
* SqLite

As mentioned previously there is very little database access that actually happens when running the application, so even local databases like SqLite or Sql Compact can be used.

To use a provider other than Sql Server you need to do the following:

* Add the appropriate Westwind.Globalization.<DataBase> assembly/NuGet Package
* Specify the Configuration.DbResourceDbD
 
### Sql Server
*no additional package needed*
```c#
// not required - use only if you need to reset provider in code
DbResourceConfiguration.Current.DbResourceDataManagerType = typeof(DbResourceSqlServerDataManager);
```  

###### Connection String Example:
	<add name="SqlServerLocalizations" connectionString="server=.;database=localizations;integrated security=true;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />


### Sql Server Compact
*add NuGet Package: **Microsoft.SqlServer.Compact***

```c#
DbResourceConfiguration.Current.DbResourceDataManagerType = typeof(DbResourceSqlServerCeDataManager);
```
###### Connection String Example:
	<add name="SqlServerCeLocalizations" connectionString="Data Source=|DataDirectory|\Localizations.sdf;Persist Security Info=False;" providerName="System.Data.SqlServerCe.4.0" />
	<add name="Localizations" connectionString="server=.;database=localizations;integrated security=true;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />

### MySql
*add NuGet Package: **MySql.Data***
```c#
DbResourceConfiguration.Current.DbResourceDataManagerType = typeof (DbResourceMySqlDataManager);
```

###### Connection String Example:
	<add name="MySqlLocalizations" connectionString="server=localhost;uid=testuser;pwd=super10seekrit;database=Localizations" providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient" />


### SqLite
*add NuGet Package: **System.Data.SQLite.Core*** 
```c#
DbResourceConfiguration.Current.DbResourceDataManagerType = typeof(DbResourceSqLiteDataManager);
```  

###### Connection String Example:
	<add name="SqLiteLocalizations" connectionString="Data Source=|DataDirectory|\SqLiteLocalizations.db;Version=3" providerName="System.Data.SQLite" />

### Global Data Manager Configuration
This code configures the data manager globally so every time a data access operation occurs it instantiates the data manager configured here. It's important that you add the appropriate assembly first, otherwise these provider types will not be available and your code won't compile.

### JavaScript Resource Handler
If you're building applications that include JavaScript logic it's likely that you also need to access localized resources on the client. This library provides a JavaScript Resource HttpHandler that can serve resources in the proper localized locale to your client application.

The resource handler allows you to specify which resources to serve and which locale - or auto-detected locale - to serve the data to your JavaScript client application.

#### Configuration
To configure the Resource Handler it has to be registered in web.config as follows:

```xml
<configuration>
<system.webServer>
<handlers>
    <add name="JavaScriptResourceHandler"
        verb="GET"
        path="JavascriptResourceHandler.axd"
        type="Westwind.Globalization.JavaScriptResourceHandler,Westwind.Globalization.Web" />
</handlers>
</system.webServer>

#### Usage
The resource handler is then accessed as a script resource in your code by calling the
static JavaScriptResourceHandler.GetJavaScriptResourcesUrl() method:

```html
<script src="@JavaScriptResourceHandler.GetJavaScriptResourcesUrl("resources","Resources")"></script>
<script>
    document.querySelector("#JavaScriptHelloWorld").innerText = resources.HelloWorld;
</script>
```

or if you're using a plain HTML page:

```html
<script src="JavaScriptResourceHandler.axd?ResourceSet=Resources&LocaleId=auto&VarName=resources&ResourceType=resdb&ResourceMode=1"></script>
<script>
    document.querySelector("#JavaScriptHelloWorld").innerText = resources.HelloWorld;
</script>
```
Either of the above generate the following script code (shown here localized in German):

```javascript
resources = {
	"HelloWorld": "Hallo schn\u00F6de Welt",
	"Ready": "Los",
	"Today": "Heute",
	"Yesterday": "Gestern",
    "dbRes": function dbRes(resId) { return resources[resId] || resId; }    
};
```

### Handler Url Formatting
A full JavaScript resource handler URL looks like this:

```
JavaScriptResourceHandler.axd?ResourceSet=Resources&LocaleId=auto&VarName=resources&ResourceType=resdb&ResourceMode=1
```

The QueryString parameters on the URL are used as follows:

##### ResourceSet
The ResourceSet name as defined in the database or the name of the ResX file relative to the ResxBaseFolder defined in the configuration.

##### LocaleId
This can be either a specific localeId like `de`, or `de-de`. Or it can be `auto` in which ASP.NET will use its default locale, which you can override to match the browser's locale as described in [Auto-detecting browser locale](Auto-Detecting-and-Setting-ASP.NET-Locale-based-on-Browser-Locale). The recommendation is to use `auto` and have IIS detect the browser locale and switch the thread UiCulture.

##### ResourceType - resdb,resx
You can specify what type of resources are loaded with this Resource handler. The options are `resdb`, which uses the dbResourceProvider/Manager or `resx` which uses Resx resources. Again in order for Resx resources to work the ResxBaseFolder must be set.

##### ResourceMode  0 (WebForms), 1 (Project/folder)
Determines how Resx Resources are loaded using either *project* (1) or *WebForms* (0) style resources. If *project* (0) resources are used make sure the ResxBaseFolder points to the path where your Resx resources like. If you use *WebForms* mode, resources are located using App_GlobalResources and App_LocalResources folders.


The localization by default uses the active locale of the current request, so if you switch
the locale using WebUtils.SetUserLocale() as shown earlier, the resources are localized to
that locale as well. You can also explicitly provide the LocaleId as a parameter in the first call, or in the `LocaleId` query parameter in the raw script call.

Note that the variable name is generated in global scope by default, so `resources` is generated
in global scope. However, you can pass in any variable name. For example, if you have a previously
declared object that you want to attach the resources to you can use that name. For example:

```html
<script>
    global = {};  //  declare your own global object on the page
</script>
<!-- generated resources to global.resources -->
<script src="@JavaScriptResourceHandler.GetJavaScriptResourcesUrl("global.resources","Resources")"></script>
<script>
    // use global.resources object to access resource values
    document.querySelector("#JavaScriptHelloWorld").innerText = global.resources.HelloWorld;
</script>
```

Note also that there's a `dbRes()` function included in the class that allows safe, string based access to properties like this:

```javascript
var strReady1 = resources.Ready; // error if not found or can be blank  
var strReady2 = resources.dbRes('Ready'); // no error, output 'Ready' if not found or empty
```
    
That is if you try to access resources that don't exist or are null//empty the resourceKey is returned. This allows for resource names that act as 'default' values or at least will  act as fail-safe that returns the key which is better than no text at all. The behavior of this function is similar to to the DbRes.T() function on the server.
